Zabbix monitoring for Ruby apps. Works with pushing and polling: push data to the agent server with zabbix_sender or collect data with the Zabbix agent.

Here you can find [Documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/sping/zabbix-monitor/master/frames)

## Installation

Requires the Zabbix agent to be installed.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'zabbix-monitor'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zabbix-monitor

To include the rake tasks in your application, add the following line to your Rakefile (before `App::Application.load_tasks`):

    require 'tasks/zabbix'

## Usage

### For Rails applications:

Place your Zabbix Monitoring configuration in an initializer:

```ruby
require 'zabbix'

Zabbix.configure do |config|
  config.config_file_path = '/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf'
  # optional, defaults to ./log/#{RACK_ENV}.log
  # config.log_file_path = '/var/log/monitor.log'
  config.host_name = 'servername'
  config.mode = :push
  config.interval = '1m'
  config.rules = [
    {
      :command => 'Monitor.new.test',
      :zabbix_key => 'zabbix.test'
    }
  ]
end
```

Put the host name as configured in your Zabbix server config in `config.host_name`.

Set the `config.mode` to one of the following options:

- `:push` uses the Zabbix agent to push the data to the Zabbix server
- `:file` writes the data to tmp/zabbix-stats.yml
- `:stdout` writes the data to the stdout

Put your monitoring rules in `config.rules`. Each rule contains a Ruby command to be executed by the Zabbix Monitor and the key as configured on the Zabbix Server.

Start running your monitoring jobs with:

    $ rake zabbix:start

### File mode

In `:file` mode, monitoring var can be read from the monitoring file using `zabbix_reader` command.
Create a script that's been executed by the Zabbix daemon:

```bash
#! /bin/bash
cd /path/to/app/
echo $( RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec zabbix_reader $1 )
```

To speed up the reading of variables, you can also use awk to look for variables. Create the following script instead:

```bash
#! /bin/bash
cd /path/to/app/

if [ -f tmp/zabbix-stats.yml ]
then
  echo $( awk -F: -v var=$1 '$0 ~ var {$1=""; print $0; exit}' tmp/zabbix-stats.yml )
else
  echo Zabbix monitor file not found
fi
```

## Capistrano

Capistrano tasks are added in lib/tasks/zabbix.rb. Currently, only Capistrano 2 is supported. Add the following lines of code to your deploy.rb:

```ruby
require 'zabbix/capistrano'

namespace :deploy do

  # if you're running God.rb, it will be restarted automatically
  after 'deploy:update_code', 'zabbix:stop'
  # else
  after 'deploy:update_code', 'zabbix:restart'

end
```
